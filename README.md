# Global_Marketing_Project

Need to create an application for users to help come up with a string to input as metadata for their product images. The user will go through the page and 'check off' the proper tag words for the item and an output area near the bottom of the page will display the tag in real time for the user to copy and paste into their documentation.

The reason this needs to be done is to develop a proper SOP and organize naming schemes throughout the department.

Challenges {

- Concatonating the output string properly to ensure all checked boxes are added properly.
- Reseting the form properly.
