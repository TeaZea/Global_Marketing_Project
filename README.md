# Global_Marketing_Project

Need to create an application for users to help come up with a string to input as metadata for their product images. The user will go through the page and 'check off' the proper tag words for the item and an output area near the bottom of the page will display the tag in real time for the user to copy and paste into their documentation.

The reason this needs to be done is to develop a proper SOP and organize naming schemes throughout the department.

<bold>As of 10/25/2022, application is being review by product team to ensure catagories and item information/organization is correct</bold>

Challenges {

- Concatonating the output string properly to ensure all checked boxes are added properly (solved 10/25/2022).
- Reseting the form properly (solved 10/25/2022).
- Logic ensuring only one value of the same name is outputed even if more than one is checked (SIMILAR TO PYTHON SET()).
- Having problems overriding bootstrap.

09/24/2022 {

- Created and edited basic index, css and script pages.

  }

10/21/2022 {

- Tried redoing scripts to get the checkbox values to show as an output but it isn't working.
- Tried other scripts including, on click for checked boxes and on click for the submit button. Didn't work. Checked console and there seemed to be some DOM errors with how the styles sheet and scripts were loading. Fixed those but too burnt out to retry the previously failed iterations of scripts.
  }

10/25/2022 {

- Created the scripts to output an alert with the tag string.
- Added reset button.
- Added more catagories. Had to stop as application will go to the back to the product team to ensure catagories/items are correct.
- Added CSS classes to index and stylesheet.
  }
